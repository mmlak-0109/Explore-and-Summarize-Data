## Welcome to my "Explore and Summarize Data" Project Page!

I completed this project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree "Data Analysis with R" course.

In this course, I learned how to do the following things:

- Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
- Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
- Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
- Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information

For this project, I used R in Rstudio to explore a data set containing financial contributions made by California residents in the 2016 Presidential election.

Both the original `.Rmd` file and the generated `.html` file can be found by clicking the "View on GitHub" link above.

Enjoy!
